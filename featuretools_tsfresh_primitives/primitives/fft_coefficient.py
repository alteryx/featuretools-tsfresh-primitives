    """Calculates the spectral centroid (mean), variance, skew, and kurtosis of
    the absolute fourier transform spectrum of entries over a given window.

    Description:
        Given a list of numbers and a corresponding list of
        datetimes, return the spectral centroid (mean), variance, skew, and kurtosis of
        the absolute fourier transform spectrum of
        the numeric values, starting at the row `gap` rows away from the current row and
        looking backward over the specified time window
        (by `window_length` and `gap`).

    Args:
        coeff (int) : The coefficient to return. Must be greater than or equal to zero.
        attr (str) : Controls which attribute is returned.
            Possible values are: ["real", "imag", "abs", "angle"]
        window_length (int, string, optional): Specifies the amount of data included in each window.
            If an integer is provided, will correspond to a number of rows. For data with a uniform sampling frequency,
            for example of one day, the window_length will correspond to a period of time, in this case,
            7 days for a window_length of 7.
            If a string is provided, it must be one of pandas' offset alias strings ('1D', '1H', etc),
            and it will indicate a length of time that each window should span.
            The list of available offset aliases, can be found at
            https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases.
            Defaults to 3.
        gap (int, string, optional): Specifies a gap backwards from each instance before the
            window of usable data begins. If an integer is provided, will correspond to a number of rows.
            If a string is provided, it must be one of pandas' offset alias strings ('1D', '1H', etc),
            and it will indicate a length of time between a target instance and the beginning of its window.
            Defaults to 0, which will include the target instance in the window.
        min_periods (int, optional): Minimum number of observations required for performing calculations
            over the window. Can only be as large as window_length when window_length is an integer.
            When window_length is an offset alias string, this limitation does not exist, but care should be taken
            to not choose a min_periods that will always be larger than the number of observations in a window.
            Defaults to 1.

    Note:
        Only offset aliases with fixed frequencies can be used when defining gap and window_length.
        This means that aliases such as `M` or `W` cannot be used, as they can indicate different
        numbers of days. ('M', because different months are different numbers of days;
        'W' because week will indicate a certain day of the week, like W-Wed, so that will
        indicate a different number of days depending on the anchoring date.)

    Note:
        When using an offset alias to define `gap`, an offset alias must also be used to define `window_length`.
        This limitation does not exist when using an offset alias to define `window_length`. In fact,
        if the data has a uniform sampling frequency, it is preferable to use a numeric `gap` as it is more
        efficient.
