        Friedrich et al. (2000): Physics Letters A 271, p. 217-222
        *Extracting model equations from experimental data*

    For short time-series this method is highly dependent on the parameters.

    Args:
        m (int) : Order of polynomial to fit for estimating fixed points of dynamics.
        r (float) : Number of quantils to use for averaging.
